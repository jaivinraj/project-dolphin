## 1. How to use this repo

To build the containers, you must first create a `database.env` file in the template specified by [`example_database.env`](example_database.env).

Following this, the containers can be built using:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 2. Refactoring üèóÔ∏è

NOTE: this repo is a refactored version of a faster (but less robust) initial implementation. Some of the functionality from the old repo has not yet been incorporated.

## 3. Functionality

### 3.1. Currently Implemented

This repo carries out the following on each update:
1. Scrape properties from RightMove
2. Cross-reference against currently processed properties to minimise computation
3. Geocode properties
4. Convert to bng coordinates for measurements in metres

### 3.2. Still to be refactored from previous version

* Incorporating custom points of interest (POIs) eg. location of friends

### 3.3. Future development

* Improve scraping to gather more data
  * Facilities in the flat
  * Square footage
  * Number of bathrooms
  * Furnished vs. unfurnished
  * Broadband speed

## 4. UI

<details>
    <summary> Show/Hide Details</summary>

The current version of this repo is being refactored üèóÔ∏è, so the code for generating the dashboard is not yet published.

Attached below are screenshots of the user interface in the original version (the one that I used to find my current flat!).

### 4.1. Implemented functionality

* Choosing properties to view (and display url)
* Markdown commenting which will save to the database
* Viewing properties on a map
* Marking properties as favourites
    * You can also filter to only include favourited properties


### 4.2. In development

* Fully customiseable bubble plots, with variables specified by user
  * Can be distances from user-specified POIs or other useful metrics
